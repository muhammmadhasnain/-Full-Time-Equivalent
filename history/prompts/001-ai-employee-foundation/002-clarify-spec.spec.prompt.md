# Clarify Spec

## User Input

```

```

## Response Summary

Completed clarification session for the AI Employee Foundation feature specification. Five key areas were clarified to reduce ambiguity and provide more specific implementation guidance:

1. Watcher Selection: Confirmed Gmail Watcher as the primary input mechanism for the Bronze Tier
2. Action File Format: Specified YAML format with type, priority, and context fields
3. Plan File Structure: Defined Markdown format with sections for objectives, steps, resources, and success criteria
4. Approval File Content: Specified Markdown format with action details and checkboxes for approval
5. Dashboard Content: Defined specific statistics and status information to include task counts by status, recent activity log, and system health indicators

All clarifications were integrated directly into the specification document in the appropriate sections, and a summary of all clarifications was added to a new "Clarifications" section.

## Outcome

The specification now has reduced ambiguity with specific format and structural requirements for key components of the AI Employee Foundation system.

## Evaluation

Five critical clarifications were successfully obtained and integrated into the specification, improving its clarity and reducing implementation uncertainty. The specification is now ready for the planning phase.
