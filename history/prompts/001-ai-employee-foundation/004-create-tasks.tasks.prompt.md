# Create Tasks

## User Input

```

```

## Response Summary

Generated comprehensive task list for the AI Employee Foundation feature with 62 individual tasks organized across 6 phases:

1. **Setup Phase**: 4 tasks for project initialization
2. **Foundational Phase**: 12 tasks for core infrastructure
3. **User Story 1 (P1)**: 7 tasks for Obsidian vault setup
4. **User Story 2 (P2)**: 8 tasks for Gmail watcher implementation
5. **User Story 3 (P3)**: 7 tasks for Claude Code integration
6. **User Story 4 (P4)**: 8 tasks for approval system
7. **Polish Phase**: 16 tasks for cross-cutting concerns

The tasks follow the required format with proper checkboxes, IDs, parallelism markers ([P]), and user story labels ([US1], [US2], etc.). Tasks are organized by priority with clear file paths and dependencies documented. The structure enables parallel execution while maintaining proper sequencing for dependent operations.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed task breakdown that translates the architectural design and requirements into actionable implementation steps organized by user story priority.

## Evaluation

The task list is comprehensive, follows the required format, and maintains the user story organization to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature.
